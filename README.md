# Cyber RF Defense Tools

This repository contains code for detecting and simulating various wireless attacks in RF and wireless domains, including:

- GPS spoofing detection
- Evil twin Wi-Fi attacks
- Noise and frequency jamming
- Radar simulations with interference (Out of scope for ESORICS - CyberICPS 2025)

Each tool is modular and lives in its own subdirectory under `tools/`. Results and visualizations are saved in `results/`.
